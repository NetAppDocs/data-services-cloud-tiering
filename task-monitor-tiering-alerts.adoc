You can view the status of tiering alerts from NetApp Cloud Tiering in the NetApp Console Notification Center. 

The Notification Center tracks the progress of tiering incidents so you can verify whether they have been resolved or not. You can display the notifications by selecting the (image:icon_bell.png[notification bell]) in the Console menu bar. 

At this time, there is one tiering event that will appear as a notification:

Tier additional data from cluster <name> to object storage to save storage space

This notification is a "Recommendation" to improve system efficiency and reduce storage costs. It indicates that a cluster is tiering less than 20% of its cold data - including clusters that are tiering no data. It provides a link to the https://bluexp.netapp.com/cloud-tiering-service-tco[Cloud Tiering total cost of ownership and savings calculator^] to help you calculate your cost savings.

The NetApp Console does not send an email for this notification.
